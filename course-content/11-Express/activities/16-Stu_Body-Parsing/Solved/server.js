// This middleware will parse that string into an object containing key value pairs

// URL-encoded data represents another way to submit a request body to the server besides JSON, which we are used to.

// For example, if we had an HTML form with an upvote field, the URL-encoded data would look something like this:

// TODO: upvote
// Create a new POST request to /api/upvotes/:review_id, substituting review_id for the id that you copied from the GET request.

// In the Insomnia interface, choose the body type as Form URL encoded, and enter upvote as the key, with a value of true.

  // example: http://localhost:3001/api/upvotes/82a3
  // {
  //   "upvote": true
